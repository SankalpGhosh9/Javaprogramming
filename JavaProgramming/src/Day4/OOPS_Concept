//		/*
//		 class  √
//		 object √
//		 polymorphism ==> can be achievied using method overloading
//		 encapsulation ==> wrapping up of data and methods into single unit (class).
//		 abstraction
//		 inheritance

		Static variable ==> its comman variable across all the objects.
		Non-Static variable ==> for using this variable object is required.
		
		Static methods ==> its comman method across all the objects.
		Static variables can be accessed directly
		but non-static variables cannot be accesed directly ,
		it requires object creation through which we can access them.
//		 
		Non-Static methods ==> It can use all directly without creating any objects.
								i.e 1)Static variable
									2)Non-Static variable
									3)Static methods
									4)Non-Static methods
									
		Note := If main method is in different Class then ,
		 we access static variable and static method using Classname.static_variable
														   Classname.static_method();
